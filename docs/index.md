# Python â€“ Pickling and Structured Error Handling

## Introduction
In this document, I will describe what Pickling and Structured Error Handling are in Python, how they can be used in programing, the benefits they provide, and share some example scripts.  This document provides the steps I took and can serve as a guidance for beginning programmers writing or modifying a script with functions.  

## Pickling
Pickling or pickle in Python allows you to convert a python object (list, dict, etc.) into a character stream (Binary).  The idea is that this character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another Python script (https://pythontips.com/2013/08/02/what-is-pickle-in-python/. Nov 2019) (External Site).  Pickled files must be stored as binary files (text files will not work, no .txt) and as such, there are different access methods we need to be familiar with.  Below is a list of the common binary access files utilized in Python (Table 1.1) (Dawson M., Python Programming For The Absolute Beginner. Course Technology, 2010).
